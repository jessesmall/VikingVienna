# Viking Vienna #

# What is this game? #

I started creating this game as a gift to my girlfriend.
It was supposed to be a small game that only took me two weeks to create, but the more I started to work with it the more I wanted to do with it.

So I decided to continue working on it till I got bored.

I am currently the only developer for this game writing all of the code and using a mix of online free assets and art assets I have put together myself.


# Where are the old commits? #

I originally started this project using BitBucket as it gave me a private repository option for free. However, after working through my game I decided I didn't mind having a public repository and decided to switch over to GitHub as the social resources are far greater than BitBucket. 

I was going through a lot more trouble than it was worth trying to transfer my old repo to github (Git LFS does not like being imported), so I decided to just re-upload the code and start fresh. I have kept a log of all previous commits and will keep the existing repo in case it is required.


# When will the game be finished? #

Being a solo developer only working on this in my spare time, progress will be slow but I love working on it so it will be completed eventually.

Wish me luck!

# Can I use your code? #

The short answer is sure. The long answer is if you find anything interesting about the code I have written send me a message and I'd be happy to explain it for you and give you some code snippets to use in your own project (sharing is caring).

# Any accomplishments yet? #
- Pluggable AI system that allows for scriptable objects to be used to allow easy plug and play creating of new enemies and behaviors
- Plug in that allows for the auto creation of a grid of nodes based on a tilemap and layer masks to be used for pathfinding algorithms
- A* pathfinding system that allows for AI pathfinding on walkable layers
