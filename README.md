# What is this game? #

I started creating this game as a gift to my girlfriend.
It was supposed to be a small game that only took me two weeks to create, but the more I started to work with it the more I wanted to do with it.

So I decided to continue working on it till I got bored.

I am currently the only developer for this game writing all of the code and using a mix of online free assets and art assets I have put together myself.

Hopefully I can soon ask you to download and play the game!
I am hoping to have a release of this game before I graduate (May 2018).

Wish me luck!
